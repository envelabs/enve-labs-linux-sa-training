# managing services
in order to identify what services a system run we can use the `ps` command

#### ps
list process running owned by the user running the command
```
$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 2485 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
 2943 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
```
#### ps -a
list all the process running in the system
